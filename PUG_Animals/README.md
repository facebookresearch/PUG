# PUG: Animals

![PUG_Animals images](./PUGAnimal_Github.png)

The PUG: Animals dataset is for research on out-of-distribution generalization and for studying the representational space of foundation models. By allowing for precise control distribution shifts between training and testing, this dataset can give researchers better insight into how a deep neural network generalizes on held-out variation factors.

It includes:
- 215,040 pre-rendered images using 70 animal assets
- 64 backgrounds
- 3 sizes
- 4 textures
- 4 different camera orientations

An example of dataloader can found in the file [PUG_Animals.ipynb](./PUG_Animals.ipynb).
